Data Scientist Role Play: Profiling and Analyzing the Yelp Dataset Coursera Worksheet

This is a 2-part assignment. In the first part, you are asked a series of questions that will help you profile and understand the data just like a data scientist would. For this first part of the assignment, you will be assessed both on the correctness of your findings, as well as the code you used to arrive at your answer. You will be graded on how easy your code is to read, so remember to use proper formatting and comments where necessary.

In the second part of the assignment, you are asked to come up with your own inferences and analysis of the data for a particular research question you want to answer. You will be required to prepare the dataset for the analysis you choose to do. As with the first part, you will be graded, in part, on how easy your code is to read, so use proper formatting and comments to illustrate and communicate your intent as required.

For both parts of this assignment, use this "worksheet." It provides all the questions you are being asked, and your job will be to transfer your answers and SQL coding where indicated into this worksheet so that your peers can review your work. You should be able to use any Text Editor (Windows Notepad, Apple TextEdit, Notepad ++, Sublime Text, etc.) to copy and paste your answers. If you are going to use Word or some other page layout application, just be careful to make sure your answers and code are lined appropriately.
In this case, you may want to save as a PDF to ensure your formatting remains intact for you reviewer.



Part 1: Yelp Dataset Profiling and Understanding

1. Profile the data by finding the total number of records for each of the tables below:
	
i. Attribute table = 10000
ii. Business table = 10000
iii. Category table = 10000
iv. Checkin table = 10000
v. elite_years table = 10000
vi. friend table = 10000
vii. hours table = 10000
viii. photo table = 10000
ix. review table = 10000
x. tip table = 10000
xi. user table = 10000
	


2. Find the total distinct records by either the foreign key or primary key for each table. If two foreign keys are listed in the table, please specify which foreign key.

i. Business = 10000 (id)
ii. Hours = 1562 (business_id)
iii. Category = 2643 (business_id)
iv. Attribute = 1115(business_id)
v. Review = 10000 (id)
vi. Checkin = 493 (business_id)
vii. Photo = 10000 (id)
viii. Tip = 537 (user_id)
ix. User = 10000 (id)
x. Friend =  11 (user_id)
xi. Elite_years = 2780 (user_id)

Note: Primary Keys are denoted in the ER-Diagram with a yellow key icon.	



3. Are there any columns with null values in the User table? Indicate "yes," or "no."

	Answer: No
	
	
	SQL code used to arrive at answer:
	
	SELECT COUNT(*)
	FROM user
	WHERE id IS NULL;
	-- for other answers we replace 'id' with other columns
	

	
4. For each table and column listed below, display the smallest (minimum), largest (maximum), and average (mean) value for the following fields:

	i. Table: Review, Column: Stars
	
		min: 1		max: 5		avg: 3.7082
		
	
	ii. Table: Business, Column: Stars
	
		min: 1		max: 5		avg: 3.6549
		
	
	iii. Table: Tip, Column: Likes

	iv. Table: Checkin, Column: Count
	
		min: 1		max: 53		avg:  1.9414
		
	
	v. Table: User, Column: Review_count
	
		min: 0	 	max: 2000		avg: 24.2995
		


5. List the cities with the most reviews in descending order:

	SQL code used to arrive at answer:
	
	SELECT city,
	       SUM(review_count) AS totalreviews
	FROM business
	GROUP BY city
	ORDER BY totalreviews DESC;
	
	Copy and Paste the Result Below:
	
	+-----------------+--------------+

	|   3.5 |     3 |
	|   4.0 |     2 |
	|   4.5 |     1 |
	|   5.0 |     1 |
	+-------+-------+


ii. Beachwood

SQL code used to arrive at answer:

	SELECT stars, 
	       COUNT(stars) AS count
	FROM business
	WHERE city LIKE 'Beachwood'
	GROUP BY stars;

Copy and Paste the Resulting Table Below (2 columns – star rating and count):

	+-------+-------+
	| stars | count |
	+-------+-------+
	|   2.0 |     1 |
	|   2.5 |     1 |
	|   3.0 |     2 |
	|   3.5 |     2 |
	|   4.0 |     1 |
	|   4.5 |     2 |
	|   5.0 |     5 |
	+-------+-------+


7. Find the top 3 users based on their total number of reviews:
		
	SQL code used to arrive at answer:
	
	SELECT name,
	       review_count
	FROM user
	ORDER BY review_count DESC
	LIMIT 3;
	
	Copy and Paste the Result Below:
	
	+--------+--------------+
	| name   | review_count |
	+--------+--------------+
	| Gerald |         2000 |
	| Sara   |         1629 |
	| Yuri   |         1339 |
	+--------+--------------+

8. Does posing more reviews correlate with more fans?

	Please explain your findings and interpretation of the results:
	
	The below table shows us the review count and no. of fans for the top 10 users with the highest review counts.
	
	+-----------+--------------+------+
	| name      | review_count | fans |
	+-----------+--------------+------+
	| Gerald    |         2000 |  253 |
	| Sara      |         1629 |   50 |
	| Yuri      |         1339 |   76 |
	| .Hon      |         1246 |  101 |
	| William   |         1215 |  126 |
	| Harald    |         1153 |  311 |
	| eric      |         1116 |   16 |
	| Roanna    |         1039 |  104 |
	| Mimi      |          968 |  497 |
	| Christine |          930 |  173 |
	+-----------+--------------+------+

	Even for the top 10 users we can clearly see that the 'Sara', who has the second highest review count has significantly lower number of fans than the ninth highest review count user 'Mimi'. So, its NOT correlated.
	

	
9. Are there more reviews with the word "love" or with the word "hate" in them?

	Answer: 
	
	Reviews with the word
	love = 1780
	hate = 232
	Therefore, There are more reviews with the word love.

	
	SQL code used to arrive at answer:

	SELECT COUNT(*)
	FROM Review
	WHERE text LIKE '%love%';
	-- We replace '%love%' with '%hate%' for the next trial
	
10. Find the top 10 users with the most fans:

	SQL code used to arrive at answer:
	
	SELECT name,
	       fans
	FROM user
	ORDER BY fans DESC
	LIMIT 10;
	
	Copy and Paste the Result Below:

	+-----------+------+
	| name      | fans |
	+-----------+------+
	| Amy       |  503 |
	| Mimi      |  497 |
	| Harald    |  311 |
	| Gerald    |  253 |
	| Christine |  173 |
	| Lisa      |  159 |
	| Cat       |  133 |
	| William   |  126 |
	| Fran      |  124 |
	| Lissa     |  120 |
	+-----------+------+
		

Part 2: Inferences and Analysis

1. Pick one city and category of your choice and group the businesses in that city or category by their overall star rating. Compare the businesses with 2-3 stars to the businesses with 4-5 stars and answer the following questions. Include your code.
	
i. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different distribution of hours?

	I picked Phoenix as the city and Restaurants as the category for the Analysis.
	Yes, The places with the lower stars (2-3) are open for more hours than the ones with higher stars. They open earlier and close late.

	+-------+----------------------+
	| stars | hours                |
	+-------+----------------------+
	|   2.0 | Saturday|5:00-0:00   |
	|   3.0 | Saturday|9:00-2:00   |
	|   3.5 | Saturday|10:00-22:00 |
	|   4.0 | Saturday|11:00-22:00 |
	|   4.5 | Saturday|11:00-18:00 |
	+-------+----------------------+
ii. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different number of reviews?

	For the places with higher ratings, the number of reviews is higher. But we can see that for 4.5 star restaurants, the no. of reviews is the least. So, the analysis is inconclusive.
	+-------+---------------+
	| stars | no_of_reviews |
	+-------+---------------+
	|   2.0 |            56 |
	|   3.0 |           420 |
	|   3.5 |           441 |
	|   4.0 |          3017 |
	|   4.5 |            49 |
	+-------+---------------+

iii. Are you able to infer anything from the location data provided between these two groups? Explain.

	No, the analysis of the location data is inconclusive.

	+-------+-------------------------+-------------+
	| stars | address                 | postal_code |
	+-------+-------------------------+-------------+
	|   2.0 | 1850 S 7th St           | 85004       |
	|   3.0 | 751 E Union Hls Dr      | 85024       |
	|   3.5 | 2641 N 44th St, Ste 100 | 85008       |
	|   4.0 | 3375 E Shea Blvd        | 85028       |
	|   4.5 | 1153 E Jefferson St     | 85034       |
	+-------+-------------------------+-------------+

SQL code used for analysis:

	SELECT b.name, b.city, c.category, b.stars, 
		h.hours, SUM(b.review_count) AS no_of_reviews, b.address, b.postal_code
	FROM business b 
	INNER JOIN category c ON b.id=c.business_id 
	INNER JOIN hours h ON h.business_id=b.id
	WHERE b.city = 'Phoenix' AND c.category = "Restaurants"
	GROUP BY b.stars;
		
		
2. Group business based on the ones that are open and the ones that are closed. What differences can you find between the ones that are still open and the ones that are closed? List at least two differences and the SQL code you used to arrive at your answer.
		
i. Difference 1:
    The review count is much higher for the ones that are open.
         
ii. Difference 2:
    The Businesses that are open are more often marked as useful, cool or funny.
         
	+---------------------+-------------------+---------+
	| SUM(b.review_count) | USEFUL_FUNNY_COOL | is_open |
	+---------------------+-------------------+---------+
	|                   4 |                 3 |       0 |
	|                 504 |                39 |       1 |
	+---------------------+-------------------+---------+
SQL code used for analysis:

	SELECT SUM(b.review_count),
		COUNT(r.useful)+COUNT(r.funny)+COUNT(r.cool) AS USEFUL_FUNNY_COOL,
		is_open
	FROM business b INNER JOIN review r 
	ON b.id = r.id
	GROUP BY b.is_open
	
	
3. For this last part of your analysis, you are going to choose the type of analysis you want to conduct on the Yelp dataset and are going to prepare the data for analysis.

Ideas for analysis include: Parsing out keywords and business attributes for sentiment analysis, clustering businesses to find commonalities or anomalies between them, predicting the overall star rating for a business, predicting the number of fans a user will have, and so on. These are just a few examples to get you started, so feel free to be creative and come up with your own problem you want to solve. Provide answers, in-line, to all of the following:
	
i. Indicate the type of analysis you chose to do:
    
	Analysis of best category according to customer satisfaction (Stars and Review count)
    
ii. Write 1-2 brief paragraphs on the type of data you will need for your analysis and why you chose that data:
    
	For the analysis of the best category according to customer satisfaction, we have taken two parameters into account - the first is average star ratings and the second is the total no. of reviews. 
	
	Note: We have neglected the star ratings with less than 10 reviews because businesses having very few reviews don't reflect the actual situation in many cases and higher number of people are required for a rating to be considered as genuine.

	
iii. Output of your finished dataset:
    
	+---------------+---------------+---------------------+
	|     avg_stars | no_of_reviews | category            |
	+---------------+---------------+---------------------+
